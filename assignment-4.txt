Q1:- Create the Example of logical operators?
 Ans = The example of logical operators are:-
        # Logical AND
        
         let a= 10;
         let b= 20;
         let c = 30;

         let result = a<b && a<c;
         console.log("is a the smallest number = "+result) 

        # Logical OR
         let x= 5;
         let y= 4;

         console.log(x == 2 || y == 4);

         Output:- true

        # Logical NOT 
         let x= 3;
         let y= 2;
         let result = !(X > y)
         console.log("Is x > y "+result)       

Q2:- Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
 Ans:- 

       >> "==" (Double Equals): Checks if the values are equal after converting them to the same type if needed (type coercion).
              Example: 5 == "5" is true.

       >> "===" (Triple Equals): Checks if the values are equal and of the same type. No type conversion is performed.
              Example: 5 === "5" is false.

Q3:- How many operators do we have in JS ?
  Ans:-  Operators In JavaScript are as follow:-

       (i) Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, %).

       (ii) Assignment Operators: Assign values and perform operations simultaneously (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=).

       (iii) Comparison Operators: Compare values (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=).

       (iv) Logical Operators: Perform logical operations (&&, ||, !).

       (v) Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand (+, -, ++, --, typeof, !).

       (vi) Bitwise Operators: Perform bitwise operations (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>).

       (vii) Conditional Operator: A shorthand for an if-else statement ( ? :).

       (viii) Miscellaneous Operators: Comma (,), delete, in, instanceof.

Q4:- What is use of parseInt in js?
  Ans:- parseInt in JavaScript converts a text (string) with numbers into an integer for mathematical use. It's handy when transforming text-based numbers into actual numeric values for calculations in your code.


Q5:- Take input from user and find the odd and even number ?
 Ans:- let number = prompt("Enter a number: ");
       
       let result = number%2 == 0;
       console.log("Is the number even:-"+result)
